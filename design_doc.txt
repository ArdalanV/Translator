Design Document

Goal:
-To create a program that successfully takes in a Python file in English and outputs a Python file in 
a target language or will take in a Python file in another language, and will convert it to English Python code

Program Inputs:
-A path to a valid Python file
-The language we want to convert the code into

Run.py:
-Where the program is ran and where the algorithm is executed
-Parses the command line arguments for the program
-Runs the appropriate translation algorithm
-Returns the translated Python file

Utils.py:
-Where necessary classes and functions utilized by run.py are written

Translations.py:
-Where all the mappings of translations are stored

### English to Target Language Implementation

Algorithm:
-Convert the Python File to a string
-Create an abstract syntax tree from the string
-Traverse through the abstract syntax tree to replace Python built ins with mappings
-Unparse the abstract syntax tree into a string
-Run the string through the brute force string modifying algorithm
-Put modified string through LLM for the user-defined variables, functions, etc to be translated
-Convert the string back to a file and output the file
